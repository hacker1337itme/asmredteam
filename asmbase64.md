Hashing file content and converting it to Base64 using assembly language is relatively complex due to the lack of built-in libraries for tasks like hashing and string encoding. However, I can provide a conceptual outline of how you might achieve this using x86 assembly language with NASM syntax, targeting a Linux environment.

### Steps Involved

1. **Read the File**: Open and read the contents of a file.
2. **Hashing**: Apply a hashing algorithm to the data (like SHA-256, MD5, etc.).
3. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert the resulting hash into Base64 format.
4. **Write Output**: Print or write the Base64 encoded string to stdout or a file.

### Example Code Outline

Below is a simplified version that illustrates how you might start this project. This example does not include the full implementation for hashing or Base64 encoding due to complexity but provides basic file reading and some structural ideas.

```asm
section .data
    filename db 'input.txt', 0
    bufSize equ 1024
    buffer resb bufSize  ; Buffer for reading the file
    hash_result resb 32  ; Place for the hash result
    base64_output resb 44 ; Max Base64 size for SHA-256 (32 bytes -> 44)
    base64_table db 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/'

section .bss
    file_handle resd 1

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Open the file
    mov eax, 5          ; sys_open
    mov ebx, filename   ; filename
    mov ecx, 0          ; O_RDONLY
    int 0x80            ; Call kernel
    mov [file_handle], eax

    ; Read from the file
    mov eax, 3          ; sys_read
    mov ebx, [file_handle]
    mov ecx, buffer
    mov edx, bufSize
    int 0x80            ; Call kernel

    ; Here you would call your hashing function
    ; Assuming it places hash in hash_result
    ; call hash_function
    ; to be implemented

    ; Here you would call your Base64 encoding function
    ; Assuming it takes hash_result and places output in base64_output
    ; call base64_encode
    ; to be implemented

    ; Prepare to write base64_output to stdout
    ; sys_write: write the Base64 encoded string to stdout
    mov eax, 4          ; sys_write
    mov ebx, 1          ; file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    mov ecx, base64_output
    ; Do not forget to set edx to length of output
    int 0x80            ; Call kernel

    ; Cleanup - close the file
    mov eax, 6          ; sys_close
    mov ebx, [file_handle]
    int 0x80            ; Call kernel

    ; Exit the program
    mov eax, 1          ; sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx        ; exit code 0
    int 0x80            ; Call kernel
```

### Important Notes

1. **Hashing**: Implementing a hashing algorithm in assembly is fairly involved. You would need to provide the code for a hash function, like SHA-256 or MD5. This implementation is non-trivial and could be fairly long, as it involves a lot of bit manipulations.
  
2. **Base64 Encoding**: Similar to hashing, Base64 encoding would require parsing the bytes of the hash and converting them to the character set defined by Base64.

3. **Error Handling**: The above sample lacks error checking (e.g., checking if the file opens successfully). Error handling is critical in production code.

4. **Operating System Dependence**: The code is written for Linux; thus, it uses Linux system calls (like `sys_open`, `sys_read`, etc.). An equivalent implementation for another OS will be different.

5. **Libraries**: For complex tasks like hashing and Base64, you might want to consider using higher-level languages (like C or Python) or linking with existing libraries instead of pure assembly.

Although this code is only a starting point, you can expand on these functions and correctly implement hashing and Base64 encoding based on your requirements. For a detailed implementation, it is generally advisable to use a higher-level language and call assembly where performance-critical components are required.
