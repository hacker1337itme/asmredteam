Turning off the screen using assembly language can be quite complex, as it typically involves interfacing with the system at a low level. However, in modern Linux systems, it's often more practical to use existing command-line utilities or system libraries rather than writing raw assembly code to manipulate hardware directly.

Here's a common way to turn off the screen in Linux using shell commands. You can use the `xset` command if you are running a graphical environment that supports X11. Here’s an example of a shell command:

```bash
xset dpms force off
```

If you're still interested in how you could potentially implement this in assembly, you would need to do the following:

1. **Write a small C program** that makes a system call to turn off the display.
2. **Compile that to machine code or call it from your assembly program.**

Here’s a simple example using a C program and then showing how you could execute that from assembly:

### C Program (turn_off_screen.c)

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    system("xset dpms force off");
    return 0;
}
```

### Assembly Code (invoke_turn_off_screen.asm)

Assuming you have the `turn_off_screen.c` compiled to an executable called `turn_off_screen`, you can call it from an assembly program like below:

```asm
section .data
    cmd db './turn_off_screen', 0

section .text
global _start

_start:
    ; Prepare to execute the command
    ; syscall: execve(const char * pathname, char * const argv[], char * const envp[])
    xor rax, rax                 ; syscall: execve
    mov rax, 59                  ; syscall number for execve
    lea rdi, [rel cmd]           ; pointer to command
    xor rsi, rsi                 ; argv = NULL
    xor rdx, rdx                 ; envp = NULL
    syscall                      ; call kernel

    ; Exit the program
    xor rax, rax                 ; syscall: exit
    mov rax, 60                  ; syscall number for exit
    xor rdi, rdi                 ; status = 0
    syscall                      ; call kernel
```

### Compiling

1. Compile the C program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o turn_off_screen turn_off_screen.c
   ```

2. Assemble and link the assembly code:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 invoke_turn_off_screen.asm -o invoke_turn_off_screen.o
   ld invoke_turn_off_screen.o -o invoke_turn_off_screen
   ```

### Running the Program

Finally, you can run your assembly program, which in turn calls the C program to turn off the screen:

```bash
./invoke_turn_off_screen
```

### Note:

1. **Dependencies**: Make sure the `xset` command is available in your PATH and that you are running in an X session where `dpms` is supported.
2. **Privileges**: Depending on your system, you may need appropriate permissions to control display power management.
3. **Direct Hardware Access**: Directly interacting with hardware without higher-level abstractions is not typical in user-space applications and can vary greatly between systems, making system calls or using existing libraries a more feasible approach.
