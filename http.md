Sending an HTTP request directly from Assembly language (ASM) involves a series of low-level operations to create a socket, establish a connection to a server, and format the request according to the HTTP protocol. Below, I'll provide an example of how you might achieve this on a Linux environment using x86 assembly language.

The following code demonstrates how to send a simple GET request to a specified host. Note that this is a basic example and may require adaptations based on your specific environment, assembly syntax, and additional error handling.

### Example: Sending an HTTP GET request using NASM and Linux x86

```asm
section .data
    host db 'example.com', 0        ; Target host (null-terminated)
    path db '/', 0                  ; Request path (null-terminated)
    request_format db 'GET %s HTTP/1.1', 13, 'Host: %s', 13, 13, 0  ; Request format
    msg db 'GET / HTTP/1.1', 13, 'Host: example.com', 13, 13, 0 ; HTTP request string
    msg_len equ $ - msg

section .bss
    sockfd resd 1
    sockaddr resb 16  ; Memory to hold sockaddr_in structure

section .text
    extern socket, connect, send, close
    extern strlen, sprintf
    extern exit
    global _start

_start:
    ; Create a socket
    mov eax, 1          ; AF_INET
    mov ebx, 1          ; SOCK_STREAM
    mov ecx, 0          ; Protocol
    call socket
    mov [sockfd], eax   ; Save socket fd

    ; Set up the sockaddr_in structure
    mov dword [sockaddr], 2               ; AF_INET
    ; Port 80 (HTTP)
    mov word [sockaddr+2], 80             
    ; IP address (example.com)
    ; Here we need to convert the hostname to IP, we can skip this for simplicity,
    ; but usually you'd use a resolver or hardcode an IP address for direct connection.

    ; Assuming we already have the IP address hardcoded as 93.184.216.34 (example.com)
    mov dword [sockaddr+4], 0x5b8c_d8c2  ; 93.184.216.34 in hex

    ; Connect to the server
    mov eax, [sockfd]
    mov ebx, sockaddr
    mov ecx, 16         ; sizeof(sockaddr_in)
    call connect

    ; Send the HTTP request
    mov eax, [sockfd]
    mov ebx, msg        ; Pointer to message
    mov ecx, msg_len    ; Length of message
    call send

    ; Close the socket
    mov eax, [sockfd]
    call close

    ; Exit the program
    xor eax, eax
    inc eax              ; Exit code 1
    call exit
```

### Notes:
1. **Socket Programming**: The code creates a TCP socket and attempts to connect to an HTTP server. It assumes the IP address is known (or would need to be resolved).
2. **Host/IP Address**: In practice, you'd need to resolve the hostname to an IP address, which can be done using DNS resolution. The example skips these steps for simplicity.
3. **Assembly Language**: The above code is written for NASM syntax and might need modifications for other assemblers (like GAS).
4. **Error Handling**: The example lacks error handling for brevity. You should check return values from system calls and handle errors appropriately.
5. **Linking**: You'll need to link this code correctly with the appropriate libraries using a tool like `ld`.

### Assembling and Running
You can compile and run the code with the following commands:

```bash
nasm -f elf32 -o http_request.o http_request.asm
gcc -m32 -o http_request http_request.o 
./http_request
```

### Limitations
This code is meant for educational purposes and may not cover all aspects required for robust applications. For more complex networking tasks, consider using higher-level languages or libraries that abstract away the intricacies of raw socket programming.
