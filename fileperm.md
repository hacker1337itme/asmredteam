In assembly language, interacting with the file system — such as changing file permissions — typically involves making system calls to the operating system (OS). The implementation may vary depending on the operating system you are using. Below, I will provide an example for Linux that demonstrates how to change a file's permissions to read-only using x86-64 assembly language.

### Example: Assembly Code to Change File Permissions to Read-Only on Linux (x86-64)

The read-only permission can be set using the `chmod` system call in Linux. The following example will demonstrate how to do this using assembly language. This assumes you have the path to the file you want to modify.

```asm
section .data
    filename db 'path/to/your/file', 0     ; Null-terminated string for the filename
    permissions db 0444                    ; Read-only permissions (in octal)

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; syscall: chmod
    ; syscall number for chmod is 90 on x86-64
    mov rax, 90               ; syscall: chmod
    mov rdi, filename         ; first argument: filename
    mov rsi, permissions      ; second argument: mode
    syscall                   ; call kernel

    ; Exit program
    mov rax, 60               ; syscall: exit
    xor rdi, rdi              ; status: 0
    syscall                   ; call kernel
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Section .data**: Contains initialized data or strings.
  - `filename`: The path to the target file, which should be replaced with the actual path.
  - `permissions`: The permissions to set (`0444` for read-only).
  
- **Section .text**: Contains the executable code.
  - We start with `_start`, which is the entry point of the program.
  - We load `rax` with the syscall number for `chmod` (90).
  - We prepare the arguments for the syscall:
    - `rdi` holds the pointer to the filename.
    - `rsi` holds the permissions to set.
  - We invoke the `syscall` instruction to make the system call.
  
- **Exit the program**: After changing the permissions, we exit the program cleanly.

### Assemble and Link the Code
To assemble and link this code using NASM and GCC (on a Linux environment):

1. Save the code to a file, for example, `chmod.asm`.
2. Use NASM to assemble the code:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 chmod.asm -o chmod.o
   ```
3. Link the object file:
   ```bash
   ld chmod.o -o chmod
   ```
4. Run the executable (make sure to provide the correct permissions):
   ```bash
   ./chmod
   ```

### Note
- Be sure to replace `'path/to/your/file'` in the string with the actual path of the file you wish to change to read-only.
- This example assumes you are familiar with using a terminal and have NASM and a suitable linker (like `ld`) installed on your system.
- Always exercise caution when changing file permissions!
