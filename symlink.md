Creating a symbolic link in assembly language can be quite low-level, but hereâ€™s a simple example of how you can do it on a Linux system using x86-64 assembly. You will need to use system calls to perform the operation, specifically the `symlink` system call.

Here's an example of how you could write this in assembly (NASM syntax):

```asm
section .data
    target db '/etc/shadow', 0          ; Target file (the original file)
    link_name db '/path/to/symlink', 0  ; Link name (the symlink you want to create)

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; syscall: symlink(const char *target, const char *linkpath)
    ; syscall number for symlink on x86_64 is 83

    mov rax, 83                          ; syscall number for symlink
    lea rdi, [target]                    ; target file path
    lea rsi, [link_name]                 ; symlink path
    syscall                               ; call kernel

    ; Exit the program
    mov rax, 60                          ; syscall number for exit
    xor rdi, rdi                         ; exit status 0
    syscall                               ; call kernel
```

### Instructions to Assemble and Link:

1. Save the code to a file, e.g., `create_symlink.asm`.
2. Assemble the code using NASM:

   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 create_symlink.asm -o create_symlink.o
   ```

3. Link the object file to create an executable:

   ```bash
   ld create_symlink.o -o create_symlink
   ```

4. Run the executable with appropriate permissions. Note that creating a symlink to `/etc/shadow` usually requires root permissions:
   
   ```bash
   sudo ./create_symlink
   ```

### Important Notes:

- You should replace `/path/to/symlink` with the actual desired path of your symlink.
- Make sure to run the compiled program with sufficient permissions, since `/etc/shadow` is usually protected and only accessible by the root user.
- Error handling is omitted for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you should check the return values of your system calls to handle any errors appropriately.
