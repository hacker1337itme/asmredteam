Creating a boot service for Linux using assembly language is a complex topic that involves low-level hardware interactions, firmware interfaces, and understanding the boot process of an operating system. Below is a simple example to illustrate how you might write a minimal bootloader in assembly that can load a Linux kernel. 

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and a real boot service would require much more functionality including proper error handling, filesystem access, and the ability to parse the kernel's headers and load it into memory.

### Example Bootloader in Assembly

This example will use NASM (Netwide Assembler) syntax and demonstrate a simple bootloader that runs in 16-bit real mode and prints `"Hello, Linux!"` to the screen when the system boots up.

#### Bootloader Code (boot.asm)

```asm
; boot.asm
[bits 16]      ; We are in 16-bit real mode
[org 0x7c00]   ; BIOS loads the bootloader at address 0x7C00

start:
    ; Clean the screen
    mov ax, 0x0003
    int 0x10          ; BIOS video service to set text mode

    ; Print "Hello, Linux!"
    mov si, message
    call print_string

    ; Hang the system
hang:
    jmp hang          ; Infinite loop to keep the bootloader running

print_string:
    ; DX: offset to the string
    mov ah, 0x0E      ; Teletype output function
.next_char:
    lodsb             ; Load byte at DS:SI into AL and increment SI
    or al, al        ; Check for null terminator
    jz .done          ; If it is null, we are done
    int 0x10         ; Print the character in AL
    jmp .next_char
.done:
    ret

message db 'Hello, Linux!', 0  ; Null-terminated string

times 510 - ($ - $$) db 0      ; Fill the rest of the sector with zeros
dw 0xAA55                       ; Boot sector signature
```

### Assemble and Test the Bootloader

1. **Assemble** the code using NASM:
   ```bash
   nasm -f bin -o boot.bin boot.asm
   ```

2. **Write** the bootloader to an image file (e.g., `floppy.img`):
   ```bash
   dd if=boot.bin of=floppy.img bs=512 count=1
   ```

3. **Test** your bootloader using QEMU (or another emulator):
   ```bash
   qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=floppy.img
   ```

### Loading a Linux Kernel

To load a Linux kernel (such as `bzImage`), the bootloader must know how to read the kernel image off a filesystem, load it into memory, correctly setup the stack and registers, and jump to the kernel’s entry point. 

Here is an outline of the steps necessary for a bootloader designed to load Linux:

1. **Disk Access**: Implement disk reading logic to read the kernel image. This usually involves using BIOS interrupts for reading from disk.

2. **Kernel Loading**: Load the kernel image into memory at the correct address.

3. **Switch to Protected Mode**: Enable protected mode (if your Linux kernel requires it).

4. **Setup Memory**: Setup stack and other required registers.

5. **Jump to Kernel Entry**: Jump to the kernel entry point specified in the kernel’s header.

### Notes
- This example is extremely basic and does not involve all the details that a production-grade boot service would require.
- Writing a fully functional bootloader with features like filesystem support, multi-boot capabilities, or proper loading of the Linux kernel can get quite complex and is an advanced topic.
- If you're interested in more advanced bootloading techniques, consider studying existing bootloaders such as GRUB or Syslinux, as well as the Linux Kernel Documentation.
