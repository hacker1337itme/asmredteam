Opening a CD drive using assembly language can vary depending on the operating system you are targeting. Below is an example of how you can open the CD drive in a Windows environment using Assembly Language. This will utilize Windows API calls. 

Here is an example in x86 Assembly using the `Invoke` convention with the `win32api` libraries. 

Make sure you have a suitable assembler and linker set up to use this. For this example, we'll use NASM assembler:

```asm
section .data
    driveLetter db 'D:',0    ; Change 'D' to your CD drive letter

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Open the CD drive
    invoke ShellExecuteA, 0, "open", driveLetter, 0, 0, SW_SHOWNORMAL
   
    ; Exit the process
    invoke ExitProcess, 0

section .reloc
```

### Notes
1. This script assumes `D:` is the drive letter of your CD drive. Change it accordingly if your CD drive is on a different letter.
2. The `ShellExecuteA` function will execute the command to open the CD drive. This may result in the default action associated with that drive being performed (like opening the file explorer).
3. You will need to link this with the correct libraries (like `user32.lib` and `kernel32.lib`) during the assembly and linking process.
4. This code is meant to be run on a Windows operating system with a 32-bit environment. Adjustments would be necessary for 64-bit or other architectures.

### Building and Running
1. Save the code to a file named `opencd.asm`.
2. Assemble the code using NASM:
   ```bash
   nasm -f win32 opencd.asm -o opencd.obj
   ```
3. Link the object file using a linker, like GoLink:
   ```bash
   GoLink.exe /entry _start opencd.obj user32.dll kernel32.dll
   ```

4. Run the resulting executable.

This should open your CD drive, or trigger the action associated with the CD drive in Windows. Ensure you have proper permissions to execute such commands on your system.
